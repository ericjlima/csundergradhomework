Xu:

I spoke with you in an email before. As a response to that email I am commenting on my total program, because my previous programs didn't really have many comments. 

So, this program should work pretty straight forward. It recieves nodes that make a tree, one to the leftmost child and one it's right sibling.

I have included a typescript showing the creation and traversal of the tree. It should be self explanitory. 

The UML diagram should also be correct.

Thank you for your time and for listening.
