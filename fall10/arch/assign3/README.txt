I approached this problem quite straight forwardly. I wrote down sudo code to get my headwrapped around the problem. The next step I took was running through some of the sample code given in the cs305 directory to understand how to write the mic1 makeup. Luckily we went over much of this problem in class so I was able to figure out the algorithm. I believe I completed this program 100%.
