I completed this assignment 100%.

The assignment asks to answer some questions so I will here. 

I created a semaphore for all consumers, a semaphore, and the outptr for every type of donut. 

From my method it is a linear distribution. 

I didn't seem to run into many problems with my implementation. My deadlock probablility seemed normal. 

Thank you. E-mail me for questions.


****** Update*******
I noticed that I forgot to transfer over some of the things I did on my local machine into mercury. I decided to turn it in again. I added a second writeup file to show this. In my previous writeup file the timestamp should say that it was submitted on time, so that proves I originally turned this assignment in on time.
