I have completed this assignment 100%. 

My deadlocks usually occur normally. My understanding isn't complete, but I believe that the depth size vs deadlock probablility is linear. I'm sure we will go over how it works in more detail during class though. 

I have included my graph file as a png, so you can use a generic image reading program to view it. 

Thank you.
