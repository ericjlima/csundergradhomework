I do not believe I finished this assignment 100%. The only thing I am missing is the buddy system, because I underestimated how long it would take me. I have a good understanding of how I would make it work but I simply do not have the time to implement any of my ideas.

First fit and best fit work appropriately. 

For my buddy system I had a concept in mind to keep the size and a alternate size (using exponents). I had done some initial work on freeing and coalescing. I had done a lot of work on my buddy system, but I think it is in my best interest to just turn in what I have worked on rather than lose points for lateness.

Thank you.
